### NOTE ON DOCKER'S DOTENV FORMAT #############################################
#
# The format used by docker compose is close to bash variables, except that
# unquoted values do not break on spaces or special characters. In compose V1,
# according to the doc, quotes are included in the value (but the doc might be
# wrong).
#
# Using the compose V2 format with quotes makes the dotenv file compatible with
# a bunch of other tools, notably just and shell scripts.
