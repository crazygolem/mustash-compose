### Infrastructure #############################################################

# Domain used for this deployment. Public services get a subdomain under it.
DOMAIN=${DOMAIN}

# Configuration for an external SMTP server. TLS is assumed (STARTTLS or SMTPS).
# The SMTP password must be placed in the file secrets/smtp-pass.
SMTP_HOST=${SMTP_HOST}
SMTP_PORT=${SMTP_PORT}
SMTP_USER=${SMTP_USER}

# Email (for the "from" line) of the system account, e.g. for notifications.
SYSTEM_MAIL_SENDER_ADDR=${SYSTEM_MAIL_SENDER_ADDR}
SYSTEM_MAIL_SENDER_NAME=${SYSTEM_MAIL_SENDER_NAME}

# If you want to use ZeroSSL instead of Letsencrypt, create a free account and
# generate EAB credentials in the "Developer" section. You get unlimited free
# certificates with that setup, pretty much as with Letsencrypt.
ZEROSSL_EAB_KID=${ZEROSSL_EAB_KID}
# Base64-encode the hmac key provided by zerossl and remove the padding (equal
# signs at the end) if any

### Personal non-sensitive configurations ######################################

# Administrator of this deployment, also used as a tech user by just recipes
ADMIN_MAIL=${ADMIN_MAIL}
ADMIN_USER=${ADMIN_USER}
ADMIN_NAME=${ADMIN_NAME}

### Miscelaneous ###############################################################

# Random, persistent string generated for this environment.
# Navidrome doesn't support env variable values from files, so I cannot use
# secrets as-is. And I'm too annoyed by the state of password storage in
# navidrome to care enough to roll my own Dockerfile to pass it as a secret ðŸ˜‘
NAVIDROME_WTF=${NAVIDROME_WTF}


### NOTE ON DOCKER'S DOTENV FORMAT #############################################
#
# The format used by docker compose is close to bash variables, except that
# unquoted values do not break on spaces or special characters. In compose V1,
# according to the doc, quotes are included in the value (but the doc might be
# wrong).
#
# Using the compose V2 format with quotes makes the dotenv file compatible with
# a bunch of other tools, notably just and shell scripts.
